Biopython has eliminated several dependencies such as Numeric and mx-text-tools, so this is now easier to install and maintain.

=== biopython-1.52 ===

Updating to biopython-1.52, which was released September 22, 2009.  Main improvements were to alignment and sequence file conversion, population genetics statistics, and the Bio.SeqIO.indexed_dict() for handling large numbers of sequences.
Add a patch to Bio/Wise/__init__.py to skip the doctest. This test fails during the install when using 'sage -i' and SAGE_CHECK="yes".
