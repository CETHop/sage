 * Here is a description of patches on top of pyzmq-2.1.11

   - patches/buildutils.patch: This patches the file src/buildutils.py. It
     remove the option -arch for gcc which was broken on MacOSX 10.5.8.
     The reason to this is that Sage's gcc spkg does not build a compiler which
     understands the option -arch of Apple's clone of gcc.
