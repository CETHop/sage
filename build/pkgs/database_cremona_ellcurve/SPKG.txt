 * Updated the database to use SQLite3

=== database_cremona_ellcurve-20071019.p0 (David Kirkby, 14th Nov 2009) ===
 * Fix trac #7464
   Remove the '-v' option to 'cp' as '-v' is not a
   POSIX option for 'cp' and was not implemented on
   Solaris. It is only to display what is actaully being
   copied, and so there is no need to use this GNUism.
 * Renamed SAGE.txt to SPKG.txt to be like other packages.
 * Added an upstream contact, and other data found in
   a typical SPKG.txt file

=== previous versions ===
 * lost to history
