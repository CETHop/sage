== Description ==

Brian is a simulator for spiking neural networks available on almost all
platforms. The motivation for this project is that a simulator should not only
save the time of processors, but also the time of scientists.

Brian is easy to learn and use, highly flexible and easily extensible. The Brian
 package itself and simulations using it are all written in the Python
programming language, which is an easy, concise and highly developed language
with many advanced features and development tools, excellent documentation and a
 large community of users providing support and extension packages.

== License ==

Brian is being developed by Romain Brette and Dan Goodman. It is released under
the CeCILL license.
