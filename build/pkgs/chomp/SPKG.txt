== Changelog ==

=== chomp-20100213.p2 (John Palmieri, Nov 18, 2010) ===

* add "sun" as a make target

* patch src/include/capd/capd/operatingSystemSetting.h so that it
  builds on Solaris on x86: the automatic OS detection doesn't
  expect Solaris on anything except a sparc.  In particular, it tests
  for Solaris by seeing if "__sparc__" is defined, whereas it should
  test whether "sun" is defined.

* don't check the version of make: Sage already requires GNU make.

* add compiler flag "-m64" if SAGE64 is set.

* set appropriate compiler flags for different platforms.

* document the requirement that "make -j..." not be used.

=== chomp-20100213.p1 (Volker Braun, Feb 26, 2010) ===

* patch src/include/chomp/multiwork/mwdata.h so it builds on Fedora 12

=== chomp-20100213.p0 (John Palmieri, Feb 19, 2010) ===

* remove a bunch of programs from the makefile: Sage doesn't use them,
  so don't build them.  (This saves time, and also building some of
  the 'extra' programs fails on Solaris.)

=== chomp-20100213 (John Palmieri, Feb 16, 2010) ===

* initial version
