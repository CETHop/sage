Since PHCpack is written in APL we are shipping binaries. A source spkg could be created if there is demand for it. We are currently shipping binaries for
 * x86 Linux, 32 and 64 bit
 * OSX PPC
 * OSX Intel 64 bit
 * SunOS 5.8

AIX binaries are available at http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html but since Sage does not currently support AIX these are not included.
