== Description ==

FriCAS is an advanced computer algebra system. Its capabilities range from calculus (integration and differentiation) to abstract algebra. It can plot functions and has an integrated help system.

FriCAS is a fork of the Axiom project -- its starting point was the wh-sandbox branch of the Axiom project.

This version of the fricas package is built using hardware independent cached Lisp files to generate the executables.
