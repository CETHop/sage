== Changelog ==

=== gnuplotpy-1.8 ===

  -- Update package to 1.8.
  -- Remove patch as it is no longer needed.
  -- The test.py and demo.py are both interactive so spkg-check is not possible without making a new test.

=== gnuplotpy-1.7 ===

  -- Modified PlotItems.py to not use with variable name, since it will be reserved in Python 2.6.
