== Description ==

Pybtex is a drop-in replacement for BibTeX written in Python.

We use the bazaar trunk because it is less buggy and more feature-rich.
The latest version is available through this command:

    bzr branch lp:pybtex


This package also installs pyparsing and PyYAML which are needed for pybtex.
