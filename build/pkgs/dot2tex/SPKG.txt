== Description ==

dot2tex is a python module, whose purpose is to give graphs generated
by Graphviz a more LaTeX friendly look and feel. This is accomplished
by converting xdot output from Graphviz to a series of PSTricks or
PGF/TikZ commands.

Uses pyparsing readily included in matplotlib. To this end, the patch
in patch/ replaces the "import pyparsing" by "import
matplotlib.pyparsing".

graphviz (www.graphviz.org) should be installed and in the path (for
example via the graphviz spkg).
