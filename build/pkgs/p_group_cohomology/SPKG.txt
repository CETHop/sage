== Dependencies ==

- The SmallGroups library needs to be installed.
- For p-groups with a prime p>2, we require Singular at least in version 3-1-0.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

The package is very likely to not build or at least to not work properly
on Motorola processors (because of endianness).

Note that most of the code is original. Therefore we included the files from
src into the Mercurial repository.

The package includes a modified version of the Aachen C-MeatAxe. Since the
changes are major, we included the modified sources into the Mercurial
repository. A MeatAxe version that comes closest to what we started with
is provided in the folder mtxoriginal.

== Testing ==

Our package does not provide a separate test suite for the MeatAxe C-library or
David Green's routines for the computation of minimal projective resolutions.
But it is of course equipped with extensive doc tests in the Cython code.

Note that internet access is required for these tests, as it is attempted to
download cohomology rings from a public data base in the web.

The scripts ``spkg-check`` and ``spkg-check-quickly`` walk through all public
methods of all classes in all modules of our package and perform the respective
doc test. ``spkg-check-quickly`` runs over many doc tests at once, which is
faster, but makes it sometimes difficult to find out which doc test actually
failed. Moreover, since the same Singular sub-process is used for all tests,
errors might occur by creating too many temporary variables in the Singular
interface (this only occurs on some machines).

Therefore, we recommend to use ``spkg-check`` for testing. It tells exactly
which doc test failed, and it launches a clean Singular process for any
example.

Both test suites also check whether there is any method without a doc test. The
test suites must be executed in a Sage shell. Note that spkg-check is executed
right after installation of the package, if the environment variable SAGE_CHECK
is 1 (do "export SAGE_CHECK=1" on the command line before installation).
