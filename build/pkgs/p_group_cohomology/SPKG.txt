== Acknowledgements ==

The development of the initial version of this SPKG was funded by
the German Science Foundation, DFG project GR 1585/4.1, and was
accomplished at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena.

Since version 1.0.1, the further work on this SPKG is funded
by Marie Curie grant MTKD-CT-2006-042685 and is pursued at
the National University of Ireland, Galway.

We thank William Stein for giving us access to various computers
on which we could build test the SPKG and on which some huge computations
could be completed, and acknowledge the support by National Science
Foundation Grant No. DMS-0821725.

We thank Mathieu Dutour Sikitic for hints on how to use GAP
more efficiently.

We owe Peter Symonds the idea of using the Poincare series in a
rather efficient completeness criterion.

== Dependencies ==

- The SmallGroups library needs to be installed in GAP.
- For p-groups with a prime p>2, we require Singular at least in version 3-1-0.

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

The package is very likely to not build or at least to not work properly
on Motorola processors (because of endianness).

Note that most of the code is original. Therefore we included the files from
src into the Mercurial repository.

The package includes a modified version of the Aachen C-MeatAxe. Since the
changes are major, we included the modified sources into the Mercurial
repository. A MeatAxe version that comes closest to what we started with
is provided in the folder mtxoriginal, that is not under revision control.

== Testing ==

Our package does not provide a separate test suite for the MeatAxe C-library or
David Green's routines for the computation of minimal projective resolutions.
But it is of course equipped with extensive doc tests in the Cython code.

Note that internet access is required for these tests, as it is attempted to
download cohomology rings from a public data base in the web.

The script ``spkg-check`` walks through all public methods of all classes
in all modules of our package and perform the respective doc test. Note
that spkg-check is executed  right after installation of the package, if
the environment variable SAGE_CHECK is yes (do "export SAGE_CHECK=yes" on
the command line before installation). Should a test fail, details are
displayed on screen and can also be find in SAGEROOT/install.log.

== Changelog ==

  * 2.0 (Simon King, April 2010): The package can now compute modular
    cohomology rings for *any* finite groups (not just for p-groups).
    This is implemented in a new module pGroupCohomology.modular_cohomology,
    that builds on top of the old pGroupCohomology.cohomology module.
    While developing this extension, many rough edges of the old code
    have been smoothened as well. The build process now uses environment
    variables such as $MAKE or $MKDIR, in order to increase portability.
  * 1.2.p0 (Dima Pasechnik and Simon King, March 2010):
    Adding .hgignore (ignoring src/db and mtxoriginal).
    Adding a robuster test for the existence of the SmallGroups library.
  * 1.2 (Simon King, October 2009):
    Modified printing for cocycles, minor bug fixes and code improvements.
    The data base at sage.math has moved.
    New: Persistent Group Cohomology (bar codes), based on ideas of Graham
    Ellis and Simon King.
  * 1.1 (Simon King August 2009):
    Yoneda cocomplex, Restricted Massey powers and general Massey products.
  * 1.0.2 (Simon King, July 2009): Fixing a computation time regression and two
    minor bugs. Changing Simon King's email address
  * 1.0.1 (Simon King, July 2009): Licensing GPL 2 or later
  * 1.0 (Simon King and David Green July 2009): First public version
