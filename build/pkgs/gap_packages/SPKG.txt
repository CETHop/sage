NOTES (Added by William Stein):

 grape -- it hardcodes cc as compiler, which of course doesn't work.
I've changed to hardcode gcc as compiler, which is more likely to work.

This directory contains several "official" and "undeposited"
GAP packages available from
http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html. They are
all released under the GPL with the following exception:
(*) grape contains Brendon McKay's nauty program.

To load a package, for example grape, into SAGE type

sage: gap('LoadPackage("grape")')

All these packages come with documentation in the
doc or htm subdirectory (e.g., for grape, it would be in
SAGEHOME/local/lib/gap-4.4.10/pkg/grape/htm). After loading all
the packages, you can type gap_reset_workspace()
so you don't have to reload them again.

A brief description of each package follows:

braid is a GAP package for computing with braids, covering curves,
and Hurwitz spaces.
(Authors: K. Magaard, S. Shpectorov and H. Voelklein)

crime - package to compute the cohomology ring of finite
p-groups, induced maps, and Massey products.
(Author: Marcus Bishop)

cryst - Computing with crystallographic groups
(Authors: Bettina Eick, Franz Gähler, Werner Nickel)

CTblLib - The GAP Character Table Library
(Author: Thomas Breuer)

DESIGN is a package for classifying, partitioning and studying block designs.
(Author: Leonard H. Soicher)

FactInt is a package providing routines for factoring integers, in particular:
    * Pollard's p-1
    * Williams' p+1
    * Elliptic Curves Method (ECM)
    * Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC)
    * Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)
(Author: Stefan Kohl)

GAPDoc is a package containing a definition of a structure for
GAP documentation, based on XML. It also contains conversion
programs for producing text-, DVI-, PDF- or HTML-versions of such
documents, with hyperlinks if possible.
(Authors: Frank Luebeck, Max Neunhoeffer)

GRAPE is a package for computing with graphs and groups, and is primarily
designed for constructing and analysing graphs related to groups,
finite geometries, and designs.
(Author: Leonard H. Soicher)

GUAVA is included here, and with Sage standard.

HAP (Homological Algebra Programming) is a GAP package
providing some functions for group cohomology computation.
(Author: Graham Ellis)

HAPcryst - an extension package for HAP, which allows for
group cohomology computation for a wider class of groups.
(Author: Marc Roeder)

LAGUNA - this package provides functionality for calculation of the
normalized unit group of the modular group algebra of the finite
p-group and for investigation of Lie algebra associated with group
algebras and other associative algebras.
(Authors :Victor Bovdi, Alexander Konovalov, Richard Rossmanith,
Csaba Schneider)

polymake - an interface with the (standalone) polymake program
used by HAPcryst.
(Author: Marc Roeder)

SONATA ("System Of Nearrings And Their Applications") is a package
which constructs finite nearrings and related objects.
(Authors: Erhard Aichinger, Franz Binder, Jürgen Ecker, Peter Mayr,
Christof Noebauer)

TORIC is a GAP package for computing with toric varieties.
(Author: David Joyner)
